# **Algorithms**

**Note: All algorithms are coded in Python only !**

## Binary Search
It searches for a specific target in the given data in no time.

## *Sorting*

### Bubble sort
Sorts the given data in increasing order through multiple swaps.

### Selection sort
Considers minimum / maximum values, leading to lesser swaps over time. Also faster than Bubble Sort.
